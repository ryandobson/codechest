\title{Extract the Final (Kept) Model from a History}
\usage{
final_model_mlm_comparison(H)
}
\arguments{
\item{H}{A history list produced by \code{\link{mlm_comparison}} and
augmented by \code{\link{append_step_mlm_comparison}}.}
}
\value{
The fitted model object designated as final (typically an \code{lmerMod}
or \code{lm} object), or \code{NULL} if \code{H} is empty.
}
\description{
Returns the kept model from the last step in a history, preferably the entry
tagged as \code{type == "final_model"}. If the last step is not \code{"final_model"},
a warning is issued and that step's \code{model1} is returned.
}
\examples{
# Given a populated history H:
# final_fit <- final_model_mlm_comparison(H)
