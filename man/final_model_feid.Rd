\title{Extract the final fitted model from a fixed-effect drop history}
\usage{
final_model_feid(history)
}
\arguments{
\item{history}{A list with class \code{"fe_int_drop_history"} containing
step entries with elements such as \code{$type} and \code{$model}.}
}
\value{
The final fitted model object (e.g., an \code{lmerMod} or \code{lm}
object). An error is thrown if no model is found in the final step.
}
\description{
Retrieves the kept model from an object of class \code{"fe_int_drop_history"}
(as produced by \code{fixed_effect_int_drops()}). If a step explicitly marked
\code{type == "final_model"} exists, that step is used; otherwise, the model
from the last step in the history is returned.
