\usage{
mlm_groupmean(df, group, variable)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame in long format, containing the data to be processed.}

\item{group}{The grouping variable (quoted or unquoted) used to define groups.}

\item{variable}{The target variable (quoted or unquoted) to calculate group means and deviations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns:
\itemize{
\item \verb{BF_<variable>}: Between-group mean of the target variable.
\item \verb{ZBF_<variable>}: Standardized between-group mean of the target variable.
\item \verb{WF_<variable>}: Within-group deviation of the target variable.
\item \verb{ZWF_<variable>}: Standardized within-group deviation of the target variable.
}
}
\description{
This function performs group-mean centering for multi-level modeling analyses.
It calculates the between-group mean, within-group deviation, and their
standardized versions for a specified variable within a given grouping structure.
The input data frame must be in long format for accurate calculations.
This function is particularly useful for creating multi-level modeling (MLM)
predictors and can be applied to multiple variables using a loop or \code{purrr} workflow.
