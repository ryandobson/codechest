\title{Test Measurement Invariance Across Groups}
\usage{
test_measurement_invariance(model, data, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A character string specifying the measurement model to be tested.
The model should follow the syntax of the \code{lavaan} package.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the observed variables used in the model.}

\item{group}{A character string specifying the grouping variable in the \code{data}
that defines the groups for invariance testing.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{configural}{The fitted configural invariance model.}
\item{metric}{The fitted metric invariance model.}
\item{scalar}{The fitted scalar invariance model.}
\item{strict}{The fitted strict invariance model.}
\item{comparisons}{An \code{anova} table comparing the four models.}
}
}
\description{
This function tests measurement invariance across groups by sequentially fitting
models with increasing constraints: configural, metric, scalar, and strict invariance.
It compares these models to assess the degree to which measurement properties
are equivalent across groups.
}
\details{
The function sequentially imposes constraints to test different levels of measurement
invariance:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Configural invariance:} Tests whether the overall factor structure
(pattern of factor loadings) is the same across groups.
\item \strong{Metric invariance:} Adds equality constraints to the factor loadings,
testing whether groups respond to the constructs in a similar way.
\item \strong{Scalar invariance:} Adds equality constraints to the intercepts,
testing whether the item means are comparable across groups.
\item \strong{Strict invariance:} Adds equality constraints to the residual variances,
testing whether the item residuals are equivalent across groups.
}

The \code{anova} table compares the models to determine if each level of invariance
is supported. A non-significant difference in model fit suggests invariance holds.
