\title{Build Full Model Formula for Mixed Models}
\usage{
build_formula(
  dv,
  fixed_effects,
  random_effects = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  model_env = NULL,
  covary = TRUE,
  intercept = TRUE,
  data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dv}{Character scalar; name of the dependent variable.}

\item{fixed_effects}{Character vector of fixed effect variable names
(can include interactions).}

\item{random_effects}{Optional character vector of random effect variable names.
If omitted, the model will include only fixed effects.}

\item{group}{Character scalar specifying the grouping variable for random effects.
Required if \code{random_effects} are specified.}

\item{model_env}{Optional environment to which the formula will be bound.
Defaults to a new environment whose parent is the global environment.}

\item{covary}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, random slopes and intercepts are modeled as correlated.}

\item{intercept}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, automatically add a random intercept if missing.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame. If supplied, checks that all variables exist.}
}
\value{
A \code{formula} object suitable for model fitting.
}
\description{
Combines dependent variable, fixed effects, and optional random effects
into a single model formula object. Designed to integrate with
\code{lmer()}, \code{glmer()}, or similar mixed model functions.
Automatically checks variable existence and environment scoping.

\examples{
\dontrun{#these examples fail to run, but they are good enough examples to
#provide a general example.
build_formula("y", c("x1", "x2"), random_effects = c("1", "x1"), group = "id")
build_formula("mpg", "wt", data = mtcars)
}
