\title{Create a Structured Report Object from an MLM Comparison History}
\usage{
make_mlm_report(history, title = NULL, verbosity = c("short", "long"))
}
\arguments{
\item{history}{A list object created by \code{\link[=mlm_comparison]{mlm_comparison()}} and updated
through \code{\link[=append_step_mlm_comparison]{append_step_mlm_comparison()}}. Must contain at least one
recorded step.}

\item{title}{Optional character string giving the report title.
Defaults to \code{"Mixed Model Random-Effects Comparison"}.}

\item{verbosity}{Character string indicating the level of report detail.
Must be one of \code{"short"} or \code{"long"}. Defaults to \code{"short"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"mlm_report"}, containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{title}}{Report title used in output.}
\item{\code{steps}}{A list of extracted step summaries (one per comparison).}
\item{\code{verbosity}}{Character string indicating the desired reporting depth.}
}
The \code{"mlm_report"} object can be passed to higher-level rendering or
formatting functions (e.g., \code{print.mlm_report()} or \code{save_apa_mlm_report()}).
}
\description{
Converts a full model comparison \code{history} (produced by \code{\link[=mlm_comparison]{mlm_comparison()}})
into a standardized report object of class \code{"mlm_report"}.
The resulting object stores key information about each comparison step
(e.g., dropped effects, retained models, test statistics) and can be
rendered or summarized in APA-style tables using downstream functions.
}
\details{
The report provides a compact representation of all model-building steps
for reproducible documentation and reporting.
It extracts core elements from each step in the \code{history} object—such as
model types, random-effects transitions, dropped terms, and comparison
outcomes—and stores them in a consistent structure suitable for export,
tabulation, or diagnostic display.

The internal helper \code{.anova_to_df()} is used to safely convert likelihood
ratio test results into data-frame form for inclusion in the report.
