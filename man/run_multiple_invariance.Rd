\title{Run Multiple Measurement Invariance Tests}
\usage{
run_multiple_invariance(models, data, group_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of models to test, where the names represent the model identifiers,
and the values are the model strings in \code{lavaan} syntax.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the observed variables used in the models.}

\item{group_vars}{A character vector specifying the grouping variables to test invariance against.}
}
\value{
A list where each element corresponds to a specific model and grouping variable combination.
Each element contains the results returned by \code{test_measurement_invariance}, including:
\describe{
\item{configural}{The configural invariance model fit.}
\item{metric}{The metric invariance model fit.}
\item{scalar}{The scalar invariance model fit.}
\item{strict}{The strict invariance model fit.}
\item{comparisons}{The comparison of fit statistics across invariance levels.}
}
}
\description{
This function tests measurement invariance for multiple models across multiple grouping variables.
It applies the \code{test_measurement_invariance} function to each combination of model and grouping variable
and returns a structured list of results.
}
\details{
This function is designed for scenarios where multiple measurement models need to be tested for invariance
across multiple grouping variables. It automates the process by iterating through all combinations of
models and grouping variables, running \code{test_measurement_invariance} for each combination, and storing
the results in a structured format.

The function prints basic progress information to the console, including the current model and grouping
variable being processed, as well as the fit comparisons for each invariance test.
