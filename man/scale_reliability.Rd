\title{Compute reliability for a single psychological scale}
\usage{
scale_reliability(data, vars, group = NULL, groups = NULL, omega_h = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the items for the scale.}

\item{vars}{Character vector of item variable names to include in the scale.}

\item{group}{Optional; a single character string naming the grouping variable.
If supplied, must also provide \code{groups}.}

\item{groups}{Optional; character vector of the group levels to include
(e.g., \code{c("male","female")}). Must be provided when \code{group} is used.}

\item{omega_h}{Logical; whether to compute hierarchical omega (\code{TRUE})
or total omega (\code{FALSE}, default).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item For ungrouped data: \code{list(uni, omega)}
\item For grouped data: A named list of such results, one per group
}
}
\description{
Computes internal consistency and unidimensionality diagnostics for a single
psychological scale, optionally separated by a grouping variable.
Returns both \code{unidim()} and \code{psych::omega()} outputs.
}
\details{
When \code{group} and \code{groups} are both \code{NULL}, reliability is
computed for the full sample. When both are provided, reliability is computed
separately within each group level.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Single group
scale_reliability(df, vars = c("item1","item2","item3"))

# By sex
scale_reliability(df, vars = c("item1","item2","item3"),
                  group = "sex", groups = c("male","female"))
}

}
