\title{Rename Rows and Columns of a Correlation Matrix}
\usage{
rename_cor(cor_mat, rename_vec, rnd = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{cor_mat}{A correlation matrix, typically produced by \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor()}}.}

\item{rename_vec}{A named character vector of name mappings, where the
names correspond to the old variable names and the values correspond
to the new names. For example:
\code{c(old_name1 = "New Name 1", old_name2 = "New Name 2")}.
Extra mappings not present in \code{cor_mat} are ignored without error.}

\item{rnd}{Integer specifying the number of decimal places to round to.
Defaults to 2. Set to \code{FALSE} or \code{NULL} to skip rounding.}
}
\value{
A correlation matrix with updated row and column names.
If \code{rnd} is specified, the matrix values are rounded.
}
\description{
This function renames the row and column names of a correlation matrix
using a user-supplied vector of old-to-new name mappings. The renaming
is "safe": if some names are not found in the mapping, the original
names are preserved. The function also optionally rounds the
correlation values.
}
\details{
The function uses an internal helper (\code{safe_rename}) to apply
the renaming. If all current names already match the new names,
no changes are made. If some names are missing from the mapping,
they are left unchanged.
}
\examples{
mat <- cor(mtcars[, 1:3])
rename_vec <- c(mpg = "Miles Per Gallon", cyl = "Cylinders")
rename_cor(mat, rename_vec, rnd = 3)
