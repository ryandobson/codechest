\title{Extract and Format Variance Accounted for in Factor Analysis Model}
\usage{
efa_vaccount(efa_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{efa_model}{A factor analysis model object (typically from \code{factanal} or similar).
The object must contain a \code{Vaccounted} attribute representing the variance accounted for by the factors.}
}
\value{
A formatted HTML table (as a \code{kable} object) displaying the variance accounted for
by the factors, rounded to two decimal places, and excluding unnecessary rows.
}
\description{
This function takes an EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis) model object and extracts
the variance accounted for by the factors. It processes the variance data by rounding,
formatting, and displaying the top rows in a neatly formatted HTML table.
}
\details{
The \code{efa_vaccount()} function accesses the \code{Vaccounted} component of an EFA model, which contains
the proportion of variance explained by each factor. It processes the data to:
\itemize{
\item Keep only the first three rows to avoid unnecessary information.
\item Round numerical values to two decimal places for clarity.
\item Format the table as a striped HTML table using the \code{kable} and \code{kableExtra} package functions.
}

This function is designed to provide a quick and clean view of the variance explained by factors in an EFA.
