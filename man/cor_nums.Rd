\title{Calculate and Summarize Correlation Statistics}
\usage{
cor_nums(df, cor_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the variables to compute correlations between. The function uses the number of columns in the data frame to calculate the total number of correlations.}

\item{cor_mat}{A correlation matrix (numeric matrix) containing the correlation coefficients between variables.}
}
\value{
A named vector containing:
\describe{
\item{\verb{Total number of correlations}}{The total number of off-diagonal correlations in the matrix.}
\item{\verb{Number of correlations larger than abs(.30)}}{The number of off-diagonal correlations with an absolute value greater than or equal to 0.30.}
\item{\verb{Percent of correlations larger than abs(.30) in cor matrix}}{The percentage of off-diagonal correlations greater than or equal to 0.30, as a proportion of the total number of correlations.}
}
}
\description{
This function computes several summary statistics about the correlations in a given correlation matrix:
\itemize{
\item Total number of correlations (off-diagonal elements only).
\item Number of correlations with absolute values greater than 0.30.
\item The percentage of correlations that exceed the absolute value of 0.30 in the correlation matrix.
}
}
\details{
This function operates on a correlation matrix (\code{cor_mat}) and calculates:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{total number of correlations} (off-diagonal values only).
\item The \strong{number of correlations} where the absolute value exceeds 0.30, which is a typical threshold to identify moderate or stronger relationships.
\item The \strong{percentage of correlations} that are above the threshold.
}

The function is useful for understanding the strength of correlations in a correlation matrix and for filtering out weaker relationships.
