\title{Grab non-significant interaction coefficients from a model}
\usage{
grab_int_coefs(model, alpha = 0.1, var = "all_interactions")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object (e.g., \code{lm}, \code{lmerMod}).}

\item{alpha}{Numeric threshold; interactions with p-values \emph{greater than}
this are returned. Default \code{0.10}.}

\item{var}{Either \code{"all_interactions"} (default) to consider all interactions,
or a single variable name to restrict to interactions involving that variable.}
}
\value{
A character vector of interaction-term names meeting the criterion.
Returns \code{character(0)} if none are found.
}
\description{
Extracts interaction-term names from a fitted model whose p-values exceed
\code{alpha}. Optionally restricts to interactions involving a single variable.
}
\details{
P-values are obtained from \code{summary(model)$coefficients}. The
p-value column is located dynamically.
